# Support Engineer Technical Interview Challenge

## Overview

You have been provided with a NextJS TypeScript banking application that has several reported customer issues. Your goal is to **investigate, document root causes, and resolve as many bugs as possible within 2 hours**. Extra credit will be given for adding tests that verify your fixes.

## The Application

**SecureBank** is a modern banking application with the following features:

- User registration (multi-step form)
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Account management (create checking/savings accounts)
- Fund accounts (via card or bank transfer)
- View transaction history

## Your Mission

1. **Investigate reported issues** and document root causes
2. **Fix the identified bugs** with proper solutions
3. **Write clear documentation** explaining:
   - What caused each bug
   - How the fix resolves it
   - What preventive measures can avoid similar issues
4. **[Extra Credit] Add tests** to verify your fixes
5. **Prioritize issues** based on user impact

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Database

The app uses SQLite and will automatically create a `bank.db` file on first run.

**Helpful database commands:**

```bash
npm run db:list-users      # List all users
npm run db:list-sessions   # List all sessions
npm run db:clear          # Clear all data
npm run db:delete-user    # Delete specific user
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: JWT-based sessions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form
